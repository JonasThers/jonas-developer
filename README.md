<h3>About</h3>
<hr />
<p>This is more or less an online version of my CV with a more personal touch to it</p>
<br />

<h3>Main goal</h3>
<hr />
<p>One thing which I wanted to achieve with this project was to create a React app - without using create-react-app, which prior to this had been my go to-template for all of my React projects. I wanted to learn more about Webpack, and decided to try to set up my own template using Webpack and Babel.</p>
<p>This ended up becoming the foundation of my <a href="https://github.com/JonasThers/React-Template">React template</a>, which I have used for other hobby projects</p>
<br />

<h3>Technologies used</h3>
<hr />

<ul>
   <li>Webpack</li>
   <li>Babel</li>
   <li>React Hooks</li>
   <li>Sass</li>
</ul>
